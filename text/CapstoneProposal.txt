This is something I would like to focus on with my final project. The propose of my capstone is to fill two major needs that I see in the volunteer community.
	First of all I see an issue with volunteer organizations being able to find the proper, reliable help that they need. I think this stems from two major factors -  first that it's difficult for them to accurately express the array of skill levels that they need to complete a task, and second that it's hard for them to accurately assess the commitment level of the volunteers that say they're willing to show up. These are the biggest issues I would like to address on the organization's side of the user story, along with a couple more minor accommodations. 
	On the volunteer side, I can identify two main issues as well. First, I see a general level of anxiety coming from both first time volunteers and seasoned volunteers that are joining an organization for the first time when they are exploring the idea of going outside their comfort zone. I believe that if a communication barrier can be broken down through comfortable interaction with the user interface, that both the volunteer and the organization can benefit. I also see hesitance from possible volunteers that have a high skill level (as well as those with none at all) when exploring opportunities because they would like to find something that would be a good fit for their skill level. Again, I believe both the volunteer and the organization could both greatly benefit from a pre-decleration both of skills/expectations of the volunteer, as well as the skills/needs of the organization.  
	These issues are the inspiration for my capstone. What I would like to create is a web application that both volunteers and organizations can actively engage with to solve multiple large and small issues in the volunteer process. Some of the larger parts of my user stories are as follows:

As a user: 
I would like to be able to sign up and log in to the application
I would like the ability to build a profile with information about myself and my history as it may (or may not) pertain to volunteer opportunties.
